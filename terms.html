      Providers/Partners, Zebo will try to ask Providers/Partners to issue the customer a refund or credit for the value
      of that item as stated in this paragraph. Zebo can't be held liable for any loss or damage. You can always leave

      customer a refund or credit for the value of that item as specified in the National Fair Claims Guide from
      the International Fabricare Institute (“IFI”). This guide considers the average life of the garment,
      depreciation for the age of the item, and the current replacement cost. If the customer is unable to
      document the age of a garment, we reserve the right to limit the maximum age of any garment to
      one year. If no current replacement cost is available we reserve the right to use the
      replacement cost of a comparable item currently available." Please note Zebo’s
      Providers/Partners are not liable for any pre-existing damage to garments or other item(s) and reserves the
      right to return any item without cleaning it if any pre-existing damage is found or if partners have a concern
      about the colourfastness or the age or weakness of the fabric. All refunds/reimbursements offered by Zebo’s
      Providers/Partners to the customer, must be claimed by the customer within a 30 days period. Once the 30 day
